    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p><strong>The Gift of Hijab:</strong> Amira had always been fascinated by the colorful scarves her mother and grandmother wore. As a young Muslim girl, she was curious about the significance of the hijab.
    <br><br>One day, Amira's grandmother, Jiddah, sat her down and began to explain. "The hijab is not just a piece of cloth, Amira. It's a symbol of our faith, our identity, and our connection to Allah." The hijab is just a reminder of the beauty and strength that's always been within you.</p>
    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> To provide a means for Muslim women to express their faith, values, and identity through their attire.</p>
    <p><strong>Vision:</strong> To create a world where Muslim women can confidently and proudly express their identity without fear of judgment or persecution.</p>
